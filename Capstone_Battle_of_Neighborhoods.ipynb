    "Toronto is the heart of Ontario, Canada with a population of 2.93 Million people. It is the most densely populated and urban place of Canada, and known best for the CN tower, Scotiabank Arena, Toronto Islands, and much more. Aside from being the most popular cities to visit in Canada, it is also a crucial business hub, contains many universities, attractions, and residential areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to that reason, the city continuously expands with new venues creating a very competitive atmosphere for entrepreneurs looking to open a location based business. The location of the venue tremendously impacts the strength of the business.\n",

Doing so can benefit entrepreneurs looking to open business by choosing the cluster supporting the type of business.\n",
